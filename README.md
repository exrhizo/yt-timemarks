# yt-timemarks _Chrome Extension_

**Easily bookmark the best moments in YouTube videos!**

Default shortcuts are:

 - **b** to capture timestamp
 - **v** to capture with a note

### Optimized for networked thought 

Developed to work easily with [Roam](https://roamresearch.com).

Curious to hear suggestions, I created this to have a pipeline for creating video essays, and remixing existing videos.
